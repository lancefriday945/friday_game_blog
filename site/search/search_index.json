Last year it was at my house and it was time for a change of pace. We had people come from Kansas City, MO, Birmingham, AL, and Dallas, TX. The drive was a little over 6 hours for all of us. The place we stayed was called Ferncliff Camp and Conference Center. The space was a bit older, but for the most part suited our needs. The privacy of the rooms and the convenience of how close the gaming space was to our rooms was amazing. However, the showers were extremely small and some of the rooms smelled like mildew. I believe that was due to the dehumidifiers not bering ran before we arrived. There were other activities that could have been done on the grounds such as hiking, canoeing, gaga ball, fishing, sand volleyball, basketball, and more. Some of our group took part in the canoeing. Info Even though the space was older and out of date, I believe everyone had a good time and potentially would come back.
